There are also complementary features around bootstrapping liquidity, raising funds through a public sale, and also managing access and vesting. This functionality has already been implemented in the blockchain and indexing infrastructure, and very mature designs have already been designed, what remains is to ship a fully working experience which productizes this."

However, there are plenty of features which do require more substantial quantities of tokens, such as buying NFTs or Creator Tokens, and conversely, as a creator you are likely eager to not only have the native token, but to cash out to Fiat. For both of these reasons we are working on introducing a proper in-app on/off ramp for consumers and creators of an Atlas app. There are many great ramp partners, such as Transak, which have robust low-friction buy/sell widgets for crypto using credit cards, Apple/Google pay, from across a large number of jurisdictions."

Introducing server-side transcoding in Orion will unlock this, and many other future benefits that come from server-side post-processing (thumbnail extractions, auto-subtitling, etc.).
